For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Always finish coding a file thoroughly never skip adding code.  Never add comments saying "the rest of the code remains the same", make sure it does remain the same and add all needed code to the file.
